# PlantGaurd
PlantGuard is a computer vision-based neural network model built to detect plant diseases from leaf images. This repository focuses solely on the core deep learning model that powers the detection

This repo contains:
	•	A custom or transfer learning-based CNN model for classifying plant leaf diseases
	•	Image preprocessing and data augmentation pipelines
	•	Training, validation, and evaluation scripts
	•	Model performance metrics and visualizations (accuracy, loss curves, confusion matrix)

Model Features
	•	Input: RGB images of plant leaves (e.g., 224x224 resolution)
	•	Architecture: Custom CNN 
	•	Output: Probability distribution over multiple disease classes
	•	Optimized using cross-entropy loss and Adam optimizer
